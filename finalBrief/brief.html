                        The project that I will be updating is the Every Picture project and the areas that I will be focusing on are the visual design as well as the functionality with more emphasis on functionality.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In more detail, how I plan to update the Every Picture project is to firstly implement the zoom effect on each image that was originally supposed to be put into place. I will additionally be fixing some bugs that were mentioned within the peer review such as the malfunctioning of the button where the button loses all CSS when the page refreshes or when the screen is resized. This part will cover the functionality of the site. As for the visual design of the project, I intend on implementing a slideshow on each place I visited in Europe with the zoom effect in place.

                    <p>
                        Therefore, thereâ€™d be three slideshows in total. Each slideshow would be spaced a good distance apart from each other vertically down the site so that the smooth scroll effect can still be in effect. Lastly, as each slideshow is sectioned apart from each other with distance, I also intend to use background color to further enhance contrast between each slideshow.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For my functionality area of focus, I plan to do a code review with the graduate student TA of this class and will provide a report on their feedback. For the UX/UI portion, I plan to do usability testing with the class undergrad design tutor, and a friend photographer of mine.
