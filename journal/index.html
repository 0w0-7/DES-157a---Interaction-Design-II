                        This article is about the ways in which the user’s experience going through a form can dictate the chances they would be willing to complete it. It goes into detail regarding certain parts of the form interface that I would have initially thought were minor details not needing to be paid any or much attention at all.

                        One of the aspects of designing a form interface that caught my attention was taking into consideration the design of a button. It was understandable to me that the button should more so be read as a specific action they would be doing by clicking it such as “Create Account,” versus a simple word, “submit.” What came as a surprise to me was when the author stated that the button style should be made prominent and descriptive, to be seen and understood as different, apart from other buttons on the site if there were to be any. This made clear to me how there is a hierarchy between multiple of the same elements. That if elements were to be too similar to one another it would lack not only contrast but a sense of hierarchy and precedence between multiple of the same elements as well as neighboring elements as well.

                        The one site that comes to mind when it comes to filling out forms is the FAFSA application form. I would have to say that filling out the FAFSA application every year is one of the most annoying tasks of the school year, in part due to its slug-like server. However, I will say that the form interface does a marvelous job at making it as easy and simple as they can for users to complete it. Some of the design principles noted in the article that can be seen in FAFSA’s application process is how it breaks the entire form into multiple steps and sections, it holds help icons at the edge of every text input to provide an explanation of what exactly is needed, it starts off with simple and easy questions, and it implements a one column layout that keeps momentum moving down the page.
