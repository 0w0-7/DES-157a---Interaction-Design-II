                        The topic of the article I chose to read is on the best practices of ui design for window overlays. Throughout the article I found that points five and six were interesting and stuck out to me the most. Point number five talks about the focus that creating an overlay/modal creates. By using an overlay, the background would be darkened and the user's attention would be drawn to the overlay as it resembles something that is interactive and requires attention. Hence, causing a lightbox effect as Baskendari states.

                        <br>
                        Point number six mentions how overlays can be misused. It reveals the negative impression it can give when an overlay randomly appears. Most times overlays that appear out of the blue are unwanted and immediately dismissed. Therefore, Baskendari explains that overlays should only be initiated first by the user. This can be by the user clicking a button, following a link, or selecting an option to intentionally open an expected overlay, or at least some sort of action.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, I found it very interesting that Baskendari brings up the point that through the continuous acts of annoying overlays we all run into, people have been programmed to automatically close them without a second thought. Therefore as designers, Baskendari asks “why should we use them?” She offers ideas for a solution that in cases where overlays don’t need to be used, actions can be taken directly on the parent screen. Rather than opening a pop up overlay that takes the user out of their flow and limits their interaction to that overlay only.

                        This article is about the ways in which the user’s experience going through a form can dictate the chances they would be willing to complete it. It goes into detail regarding certain parts of the form interface that I would have initially thought were minor details not needing to be paid any or much attention at all.

                        One of the aspects of designing a form interface that caught my attention was taking into consideration the design of a button. It was understandable to me that the button should more so be read as a specific action they would be doing by clicking it such as “Create Account,” versus a simple word, “submit.” What came as a surprise to me was when the author stated that the button style should be made prominent and descriptive, to be seen and understood as different, apart from other buttons on the site if there were to be any. This made clear to me how there is a hierarchy between multiple of the same elements. That if elements were to be too similar to one another it would lack not only contrast but a sense of hierarchy and precedence between multiple of the same elements as well as neighboring elements as well.

                    <p>
                        The one site that comes to mind when it comes to filling out forms is the FAFSA application form. I would have to say that filling out the FAFSA application every year is one of the most annoying tasks of the school year, in part due to its slug-like server. However, I will say that the form interface does a marvelous job at making it as easy and simple as they can for users to complete it. Some of the design principles noted in the article that can be seen in FAFSA’s application process is how it breaks the entire form into multiple steps and sections, it holds help icons at the edge of every text input to provide an explanation of what exactly is needed, it starts off with simple and easy questions, and it implements a one column layout that keeps momentum moving down the page.
