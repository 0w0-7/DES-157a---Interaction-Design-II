                        This image is primarily interesting due to its visual aesthetic. The feeling that it expresses is quite calming and sets a coffee shop kind of scene. In addition, looking at the image alone, wnat's also interesting is that it's not clear that the picture was taken in France and near the dock at that. Though it was taken in front of a shop, it was a gelato shop, a more common form of desert. The experience behind the trip most would not be typically seen just looking at the image. The streets were narrow and the shops were small and compact. This image relates to the topic of my archive of photos as it is of my trip around a part of Europe. My archive of photos tells of the places I’ve visited and the memories that I’ve made there. Secondly, it tells of my design intentions when taking those photos.

                    <p>
                        The image is of what I believe to be a stamp from the Arches National park on July 28, 2016. I believe it is what Beverly had gotten as a souvenir from her trip there. The most interesting aspect of this image is the shape of the image and that it’s cropped . It first made me think it was a coin, but as I look at it longer, I can tell that it’s very probable that it's a stamp.  The color and lack of shine added to that assumption. Within this image, it tells me that she found this trip to be very memorable, that she likes to visit parks, and is outgoing. I also assume that her collection is of stamps that she has collected during her trips to these parks.

                <h2>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</h2>

                        This article speaks on the topic of visual literacy which is a way of analyzing images. It dives deep into the different strategies that can be used to try and understand the context of a static image. Images are more than just a picture in time. It captures the essence and story of a moment in time that is translated into a static photo. What I found to be interesting from this article were the strategies that were put into place to understand images more deeply. I’ve never come across the term visual literacy and it’s more of a practice than I would have thought. The strategies mentioned were being the detective, practicing regularly, asking open ended questions, notice details, build on others’ observations, introduce new ideas, and experiment with other ways to look closely. By implementing such a system I can understand how visual literacy can help expand a person’s knowledge and curiosity within their daily lives. It helps to fully come to one’s interpretation of anything that they may not fully understand. It helps build the picture of an image in both the literal and figurative sense.

                        Through the site <a class="link" href="https://galleryoffame.art/">galleryoffame.art</a>, I thought the site's use of space and images was fitting to their theme of a gallery. The site holds images dispersed around and when hovered over an image text would appear with a name and their occupation as a designer. When clicked upon, the image expands, all else fades into the background, and a description of their work appears. The questions asked and analyzed about the site to me was “Was there a purpose in how they were scattered? Were some related in some way to each other, possibly by the same design work?”

                <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
                <h3>Oct 18, 2023 &mdash; <a class="link" href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Article Link</a></h3>

                        The topic of the article I chose to read is on the best practices of ui design for window overlays. Throughout the article I found that points five and six were interesting and stuck out to me the most. Point number five talks about the focus that creating an overlay/modal creates. By using an overlay, the background would be darkened and the user's attention would be drawn to the overlay as it resembles something that is interactive and requires attention. Hence, causing a lightbox effect as Baskendari states.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Point number six mentions how overlays can be misused. It reveals the negative impression it can give when an overlay randomly appears. Most times overlays that appear out of the blue are unwanted and immediately dismissed. Therefore, Baskendari explains that overlays should only be initiated first by the user. This can be by the user clicking a button, following a link, or selecting an option to intentionally open an expected overlay, or at least some sort of action.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, I found it very interesting that Baskendari brings up the point that through the continuous acts of annoying overlays we all run into, people have been programmed to automatically close them without a second thought. Therefore as designers, Baskendari asks “why should we use them?” She offers ideas for a solution that in cases where overlays don’t need to be used, actions can be taken directly on the parent screen. Rather than opening a pop up overlay that takes the user out of their flow and limits their interaction to that overlay only.

                <h2>Best practices for form design</h2>
                <h3>Oct 15, 2023 &mdash; <a class="link" href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Article Link</a></h3>

                <div class="pContain">
                    <p id="blogP1">
                        This article is about the ways in which the user’s experience going through a form can dictate the chances they would be willing to complete it. It goes into detail regarding certain parts of the form interface that I would have initially thought were minor details not needing to be paid any or much attention at all.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One of the aspects of designing a form interface that caught my attention was taking into consideration the design of a button. It was understandable to me that the button should more so be read as a specific action they would be doing by clicking it such as “Create Account,” versus a simple word, “submit.” What came as a surprise to me was when the author stated that the button style should be made prominent and descriptive, to be seen and understood as different, apart from other buttons on the site if there were to be any. This made clear to me how there is a hierarchy between multiple of the same elements. That if elements were to be too similar to one another it would lack not only contrast but a sense of hierarchy and precedence between multiple of the same elements as well as neighboring elements as well.
                    </p>
                    

                    <p>
                        The one site that comes to mind when it comes to filling out forms is the FAFSA application form. I would have to say that filling out the FAFSA application every year is one of the most annoying tasks of the school year, in part due to its slug-like server. However, I will say that the form interface does a marvelous job at making it as easy and simple as they can for users to complete it. Some of the design principles noted in the article that can be seen in FAFSA’s application process is how it breaks the entire form into multiple steps and sections, it holds help icons at the edge of every text input to provide an explanation of what exactly is needed, it starts off with simple and easy questions, and it implements a one column layout that keeps momentum moving down the page.
