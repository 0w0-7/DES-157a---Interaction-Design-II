                    The Sopraelevata Aldo Moro is a five-kilometer long elevated highway in Genoa, Italy that runs along the port. It's also known as the strada sopraelevata di Genova, which translates to "elevated highway of Genoa". This elevated urban highway separates the Genoese old town from the historic harbor. This 16-meter-wide elevated road was built in just one and a half years, opening on August 25, 1965. Supported by 210 pillars, it connects the districts of Foce and Sampierdarena, offering a solution to the challenge of private transport navigating the old town. While it reflected the spirit of the 1960s, the project faced significant opposition from those concerned about preserving the cityscape.

                    Within this image holds a lot of history and consideration that went into its construction. Not able to be seen as the image was taken in the direction of the city, however, behind the image was the port of Genoa. And with a closer inspection, graffiti could be seen covering the beams supporting the highway.

                    This image here is simply of an electrical box covered in paint and graffiti. What this image doesn’t reflect is the fact that graffiti is quite common in Genoa and that there are actually many more places where this face graffiti occurs. Another was spotted down an alley near the port of Genoa.

                <p class="description">
                    Here in Genoa, graffiti is seen as a form of artistic expression due to the growth of street art movements. Graffiti also became an integrated part of their culture, leading to cultural events in Genoa celebrating street art.

                    What may seem like a front view of a building or shop is actually exactly what it seems like. This is an image of a street of shops selling things from clothes, coffee, gelato, and local bakeries. What can be noticed are people sitting down at a table in front of these shops. However, it’s very hard to tell how wide the sidewalk is for people to walk through. In fact, it was very narrow and the whole side of that street was compact. Issuing a very claustrophobic feeling. The shop that I had visited was a small gelato shop barely capable of fitting a group of ten. The gelato was very smooth and flavorful. In direct translation, gelato means ice cream in Italian. However, the texture of Italian gelato is denser, smoother, and richer than American ice cream.

                    The Astronomical Clock of the Cathedral of Messina, located in the Cathedral's bell tower in Messina, Sicily, is an intricate timepiece created between 1755 and 1933 by the Sicilian monk and mathematician Giovanni Maria Catalano. This historical clock boasts multiple dials and moving parts, displaying not only the time but also astronomical and astrological information, including celestial positions, moon phases, and a zodiac dial. It has undergone several restorations and remains a popular tourist attraction, captivating visitors with its remarkable complexity and daily "Show of the Apostles." About a mile out from this clock, a classical tune could be heard as I was walking towards it.

                    In this image is the top of the island where the city and the sea could be seen. What's more is that this section up top the mountain is the Saluting Battery. The Saluting Battery is an artillery battery in Valletta, Malta. It was built in the 16th century by the Order of Saint John. The battery was used as a defensive and ceremonial platform. But it was also where gun salutes were fired to greet dignitaries or ships visiting the island, to mark national and religious occasions, and to announce important naval and military victories. Today, a cannon is fired Monday through Saturday at noon and 4pm with great ceremony. The passage of time is marked twice daily from here with gunfire at noon (12.00 hrs) and afternoon (16.00 hrs).
