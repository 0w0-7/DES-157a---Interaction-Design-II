                        The Sopraelevata Aldo Moro is a five-kilometer long elevated highway in Genoa, Italy that runs along the port. It's also known as the strada sopraelevata di Genova, which translates to "elevated highway of Genoa". This elevated urban highway separates the Genoese old town from the historic harbor. This 16-meter-wide elevated road was built in just one and a half years, opening on August 25, 1965. Supported by 210 pillars, it connects the districts of Foce and Sampierdarena, offering a solution to the challenge of private transport navigating the old town. While it reflected the spirit of the 1960s, the project faced significant opposition from those concerned about preserving the cityscape.

                        Within this image holds a lot of history and consideration that went into its construction. Not able to be seen as the image was taken in the direction of the city, however, behind the image was the port of Genoa. And with a closer inspection, graffiti could be seen covering the beams supporting the highway.

                        What may seem like a front view of a building or shop is actually exactly what it seems like. This is an image of a street of shops selling things from clothes, coffee, gelato, and local bakeries. What can be noticed are people sitting down at a table in front of these shops. However, itâ€™s very hard to tell how wide the sidewalk is for people to walk through. In fact, it was very narrow and the whole side of that street was compact. Issuing a very claustrophobic feeling. The shop that I had visited was a small gelato shop barely capable of fitting a group of ten. The gelato was very smooth and flavorful. In direct translation, gelato means ice cream in Italian. However, the texture of Italian gelato is denser, smoother, and richer than American ice cream.

                        Although what is only shown is the back alleyway, this picture was taken from a toutist site just right beside it. On Malta, the Barrakka Lift was taken up to the top of the island that overseas the city of Malta. To the right of the image shown in the next image is the water.
