                        I tested my project on Skylar Laroche and Enoch Lin. Skylar Laroche is the teaching assistant for DES 157A and has knowledge within the User Experience and User Interface design space and was able to test my design with that knowledge in mind. Enoch Lin was a software engineer that has had experience working closely with User Experience and User Interface design to implement design concepts.

                        The key issues I found conducting the user testing concerned the visual elements within the design. The design elements that brought up for refinement were font size changes, leading, and a more interactive and fun experience. In more detail, there should have been a title that allows the users to understand how the images are related to each other within each separate slideshow. There needs to be a change in text size for the title per each image and content. Due to long paragraphs, increasing the leading on each paragraph would allow for an easier reading experience. The good feedback I had received was on the portion of the top of the page where the header section doesnâ€™t completely fill and stretch to fill the page, but allows the user to understand there is further content below. Lastly, the gray area surrounding the arrow keys on each slideshow made it easier for the users to understand the vicinity in which they were able to click on the image. Within this design I tested my project on Skylar Laroche, a teaching assistant for the class DES 157A. He has knowledge within the User Experience and User Interface design space and was able to test my design with that knowledge in mind. Enoch Lin was a software engineer that has had experience working closely with User Experience and User Interface design to implement design concepts. The tasks within my design include viewing and scrolling through the slideshow, reading through the context of each picture, and using the buttons to get around the site. The user test was done with a prototype of the final design, however, not all functions within the site were built. In that sense there were bugs that occurred through user testing.
